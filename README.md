Streamflow Generator (Qsynth)
=============================

**Streamflow generator** synthesises an artificial streamflow time series with daily values. The generation merely based on an observed streamflow time series. The implemented approach takes roughly a bearing described in Salas (1993)[^1]

Example
---
An example file how to use the generator is provided:

- *example/test.csv*: File which contains an observed streamflow time series with daily values used as input for the streamflow generator. May also be used what your input file has to look like. Otherwise the application will not be able to read the file. A blueprint is depicted in the table below.

> dd-mm-YYYY       | x3
